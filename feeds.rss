Sports5 file/Pranz Kaeno Billones</p></div> <p>Yeng Guiao is currently in the thick of his quest to win his first All-Filipino tournament, leading the Rain or Shine Elasto Painters in the PLDT Home DSL Philippine Cup finals against the San Mig Super Coffee Mixers.</p> <p>The fiery coach is once again battling the same Purefoods franchise that denied him his first attempt to win the All-Filipino way back in 1991.</p> <p>Guiao&#8217;s Diet Sarsi squad lost in five games to a Purefoods team coached by Ely Capacio, who passed away last Sunday at age 58.</p> <p>&#8220;Coach Ely is also a passionate coach,&#8221; said Guiao of Capacio, a former player with Tanduay before coaching Purefoods. Capacio later transitioned into a corporate role with San Miguel Corporation before serving in the PBA Board of Governors representing the San Miguel Beer and Petron franchise.</p> <p>&#8220;He knows his basketball and he&#8217;s a leader. These are probably the reasons why he got up in the ladder of success was because he had those characteristics,&#8221; said Guiao.</p> <p>The leader of that Purefoods squad, four-time PBA Most Valuable Player Alvin Patrimonio, remains with the franchise as team manager of San Mig Cofee.</p> <p>&#8220;Siyempre yung first All-Filipino championship namin siya yung coach namin,&#8221; Patrimonio said about Capacio..</p> <p>&#8220;Maganda yung team noon, but he imposed discipline on the team. Kaya maganda naman yung resulta nag-champion kami.&#8221;</p> <p>That season was memorable for Patrimonio, who won his first MVP trophy that year.</p> <p>&#8220;Dati yung team namin star-studded pero kontrolado niya yung team noon. Kaya nga Father ang tawag sa kanya kasi respected siya,&#8221; said Patrimonio. </p> <p>He was surprised when Capacio abruptly resigned from the team to embark on a management career away from the spot.</p> <p>&#8220;Gulat lang ako kasi hindi niya itinuloy yung coaching career niya. Siguro yun ang calling sa kanya sa corporate world pero successful rin siya,&#8221; said Patrimonio.</p> <p>Guiao said Capacio&#8217;s passing also came as a surprise.</p> <p>&#8220;He was very strong and he&#8217;s still very young. He&#8217;s still at the peak of his mental and even physical strengths. It gives you a reality check. It humbles you, pwede itong mangyari kahit kanino and you have to be ready. Pero sana naman huwag muna tayo kunin ni Lord,&#8221; said Guiao. </p> <p>&#8220;But he&#8217;s a big part of this league. The fans, the teams, all the people who have enjoyed the PBA, owe him a debt of gratitude.&#8221;</p>

Wala, down-to-earth talaga,&#8221; said Pingris.</p> <p>Fajardo just won Best Player of the Conference honors in the PLDT Home DSL Philippine Cup. Pingris was among the first player to congratulate Fajardo for the honor.</p> <p>But while Pingris is happy for his Gilas buddy, there&#8217;s one thing he&#8217;s sure he still bests Fajardo.</p> <p>&#8220;Mas magaling pa rin ako sa kanya sa DOTA.&#8221;</p>

The two men are featured in the latest ad for San Miguel Beer along with Pingris&#8217; Gilas Pilipinas teammates June Mar Fajardo, LA Tenorio, and Japeth Aguilar.</p> <p><iframe width="640" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/z_5t8T4P0oU?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p> <p>For Pingris, the chance to work with Sotto is certainly a blessing.</p> <p>&#8220;He&#8217;s very supportive sa akin,&#8221; said Pingris. &#8220;I feel blessed sa opportunity and sana maulit (joke).&#8221;</p> <p>Curiously, Pingris stars in an ad for a brand that is making its return to the PBA, with the Petron Blaze Boosters reverting back to become the San Miguel Beermen in the Commissioner&#8217;s Cup.</p> <p>San Mig Coffee executive Rene Pardo, however, sees no problem with Pingris appearing in an endorsement for a rival PBA team.</p> <p>&#8220;Hindi naman siguro,&#8221; Pardo wrote in a text message. &#8220;Pingris like Japeth and LA are from different teams and are talents like in his other commercials.&#8221; </p>

LOS ANGELES - Jason Collins took another trailblazing step as the first openly gay man in a major US pro sports league Sunday when he took the court for the NBA's Brooklyn Nets. <a href="http://www.interaksyon.com/interaktv/jason-collins-joins-nets-takes-court-as-nbas-first-openly-gay-player"><strong>Read more &#187;</strong></a>

<div id="attachment_60377" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 650px"><img src="http://www.interaksyon.com/interaktv/assets/2014/02/jason-collins-nets.jpg" alt="AFP" width="640" height="427" class="size-full wp-image-60377" /><p class="wp-caption-text">AFP</p></div> <p>LOS ANGELES &#8211; Jason Collins took another trailblazing step as the first openly gay man in a major US pro sports league Sunday when he took the court for the NBA&#8217;s Brooklyn Nets.</p> <p>Hours after the Nets inked Collins to a 10-day contract, he came in as a substitute in the second quarter of the Nets&#8217; game against the Los Angeles Lakers, receiving the kind of warm welcome from the Staples Center crowd more usually reserved for their own players.</p> <p>It was the 13-year NBA veteran&#8217;s first appearance in the league since he went public in April about his homosexuality, a revelation that came after his contract with the Washington Wizards had expired.</p> <p>Facing a bevy of media before the game, Collins said his immediate concern was proving he still belonged in the league.</p> <p>&#8220;Right now, I&#8217;m focused on trying to learn the plays, trying to learn the coverages, the game plan, my assignment,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t have time to really think about history right now.&#8221;</p> <p>The Nets ended an 11-game losing streak to the Lakers with a 108-102 wire-to-wire victory.</p> <p>Collins was scoreless in 10 minutes, 37 seconds on the floor, missing the only shot he attempted.</p> <p>He had two rebounds and five fouls, and Nets coach Jason Kidd said he was generally satisfied with the performance from a player brought in to bolster the team&#8217;s defense.</p> <p>Nets general manager Billy King said the move to sign Collins was a &#8220;basketball decision&#8221; to add a defensive presence inside.</p> <p>&#8220;We needed to increase our depth inside, and with his experience and size, we felt he was the right choice for a 10-day contract,&#8221; King said.</p> <p>The Nets can sign Collins to two straight 10-day deals before deciding if they want to keep him for the rest of the season.</p> <p>Even though King said the Nets had no intention of making a social statement, NBA commissioner Adam Silver commented on the deal.</p> <p>&#8220;Jason told us that his goal was to earn another contract with an NBA team,&#8221; Silver said.</p> <p>&#8220;Today, I want to commend him on achieving his goal. I know everyone in the NBA family is excited for him and proud that our league fosters an inclusive and respectful environment.&#8221;</p> <p><strong>Sports world hostile to gays</strong></p> <p>As part of a sports world still perceived as hostile to homosexuality, Collins drew praise for his courage in coming out as gay by US President Barack Obama, former president Bill Clinton and many players in the NBA.</p> <p>Los Angeles Galaxy midfielder Robbie Rogers became the first openly gay male athlete to play in a US pro league when he took the field for a Major League Soccer match in May, three months after revealing he was gay.</p> <p>But Collins is the first in any of the four leagues that dominate the US sports landscape &#8212; Major League Baseball, the National Football League, the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League.</p> <p>University of Missouri defensive end Michael Sam, a US college star in American football who announced this month he is gay, is likely to be selected in the NFL Draft later this year.</p> <p>His first chance to play in the NFL would not come until an August exhibition game at the earliest, and his decision to come out immediately sparked debate on whether a gay player could really be accepted in an NFL locker room.</p> <p>Collins said he agreed with Sam&#8217;s stance that he wants to be judged for his abilities on the field of play, and not by his sexuality.</p> <p>&#8220;I hope, similar to what Michael said, I hope it&#8217;s about him being a football player and me being a basketball player,&#8221; Collins said.</p> <p>As for advice he would offer to other gay athletes, Collins said it would be the same he offered to any athlete: &#8220;Never have any fear to be your true, authentic self.&#8221;</p>
